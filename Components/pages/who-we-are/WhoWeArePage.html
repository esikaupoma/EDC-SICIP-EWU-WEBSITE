                The Skills for Industry Competitiveness and Innovation Program (SICIP), managed by the Government of
                Bangladesh, has partnered with East West University through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to
                establish the Executive Development Center (EDC). This center is entrusted with implementing advanced
                training programs aimed at developing skilled executives, entrepreneurs, and business leaders across
                priority industrial sectors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the course of the program, EDC is expected to develop a highly skilled workforce, ready to be
                engaged as mid- to top-level executives or entrepreneurs, thus supporting the growth and competitiveness
                of Bangladesh’s industrial sectors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Executive Development Center (EDC) at East West University, with the exclusive financial support of
                the Government of Bangladesh, plays a pivotal role in fostering industry-academia collaboration and
                delivering practical, experience-based training to enhance skills and productivity.
            </p>
            <p>The EDC’s training programs are designed based on rigorous industry needs assessment and continuous
                collaboration with sector stakeholders. The curricula include a combination of generic and
                industry-specific courses, along with internships and hands-on learning opportunities. Course content is
                regularly updated through feedback from industry experts, market demands, and participant input.
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, the Graduate Diploma in Leather, Leather Goods, and Footwear
                Management (GDLFM) program aims to produce mid-level managers and entrepreneurs who will make
                significant contributions to the leather and footwear sector, thereby supporting the economic growth and
                innovation capacity of Bangladesh’s priority industrial sectors.
